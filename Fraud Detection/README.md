This project is focused on creating a machine learning model that can detect fraud in online payments. 

## Overview

Online payments fraud is a growing issue as more and more transactions are being conducted online. Detection of fraud in real-time is crucial to prevent financial losses for both businesses and consumers. Machine learning models can help identify patterns and anomalies in online payment data, leading to more accurate fraud detection.
